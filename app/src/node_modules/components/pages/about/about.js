                  Rights aims to make explicit what Government is doing to address human rights in Aotearoa New Zealand
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In 2014 New Zealand underwent its second Universal Periodic Review (UPR) before the United Nations Human Rights Council.  The Universal Periodic Review is a process by which New Zealand’s human rights record is peer reviewed by other countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fifty five submission from civil society, representing over 150 individuals and organisations identified the key human rights challenges and issues facing Aotearoa New Zealand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on issues raised, 155 recommendations were made to New Zealand. New Zealand accepted 121 of these.  By accepting these recommendations the Government has committed to take action to improve the realisation of rights across a number of areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Government’s actions to address UPR recommendations are set out in New Zealand’s National Plan of Action for the protection and promotion of Human Rights 2015 &ndash; 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The extent to which New Zealand has made progress against these commitments will be reviewed by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using the Universal Periodic Review as a basis for the National Action Plan provides a framework for dialogue between the government and affected people.
